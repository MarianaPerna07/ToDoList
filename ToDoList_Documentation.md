# To-Do List Application Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a full-stack To-Do List application developed using **React.js** for the frontend, **FastAPI** for the backend, 
and **MySQL** as the relational database. It includes authentication through **AWS Cognito** and is designed to be deployed 
on **AWS** for secure, scalable access.

### Objectives
- Develop a RESTful API with secure endpoints for task management.
- Provide a web-based UI for users to interact with the To-Do List.
- Implement authentication and authorization with AWS Cognito.
- Deploy securely on AWS following best practices.

## 2. API Documentation

The API is documented using **OpenAPI**. You can access the interactive documentation generated by FastAPI at:
- [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- [ReDoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

### Key Endpoints

#### User Authentication
- **`/login`** - Authenticates users and provides an access token.

#### Task Management
- **`/tasks/`** - (POST) Create a new task.
- **`/tasks/`** - (GET) Retrieve all tasks for the authenticated user.
- **`/tasks/{task_id}`** - (GET) Retrieve a specific task by ID.
- **`/tasks/{task_id}/toggle`** - (PUT) Toggle task completion status.
- **`/tasks/{task_id}`** - (DELETE) Delete a task by ID.

### Example Schemas
- **User Schema**: Includes fields for `cognito_id`, `email`, `given_name`, and `family_name`.
- **Task Schema**: Includes fields for `title`, `description`, `is_completed`, `deadline`, and `priority`.

## 3. System Architecture

The application architecture is divided into multiple layers:

- **Frontend (React)**: Manages user interaction, task viewing, creation, and management.
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: Handles requests, business logic, and database interactions.
- **Database (MySQL)**: Stores user and task data.
- **AWS Cognito**: Provides authentication and authorization.

## 4. Database Schema

### Tables
- **Users Table**: Stores user information (id, cognito_id, email, given_name, family_name).
- **Tasks Table**: Stores task details (id, title, description, is_completed, deadline, priority, owner_id).

### Relationships
Each task is linked to a user through the `owner_id`, establishing a one-to-many relationship.

## 5. Deployment Guide

### AWS Configuration
1. **Database (Amazon RDS)**:
   - Set up a MySQL instance on RDS and configure security groups to allow FastAPI to access it.

2. **Backend Deployment (Elastic Beanstalk / EC2)**:
   - Package the FastAPI app into a Docker container or use Elastic Beanstalk with FastAPI's `uvicorn` server.

3. **AWS Cognito Setup**:
   - Create a Cognito User Pool and configure App Client for authentication.
   - Update the backend with the User Pool ID and AWS region.

4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure the following are set for FastAPI backend:
   - `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`, `COGNITO_REGION`, `USER_POOL_ID`, `APP_CLIENT_ID`.

## 6. Feature Documentation

### Task Ownership
- Each user can view, create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

### Task Filtering and Sorting
- Tasks can be sorted by creation date, deadline, and completion status.

### Task Prioritization
- Users can assign a priority level to tasks (low, medium, high).

## 7. Usage Instructions

### Running Locally
1. **Start the Backend**: Run `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`.
2. **Start the Frontend**: Run `npm start` from the React application directory.

### Interacting with the Application
- Use the login page to authenticate and access tasks securely.
- Create, edit, toggle, and delete tasks as needed.

## 8. Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
- Notifications for upcoming task deadlines via Amazon SNS.
- Enhanced user interface for mobile compatibility.
- Additional task attributes (e.g., categories).
